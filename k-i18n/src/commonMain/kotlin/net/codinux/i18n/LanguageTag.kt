/**
 * A BCP 47 language tag, for example en, en-US or zh-Hans-HK.
 * References:
 * [https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47)
 *
 * It does however not implement the full language tag specification. The full specification is:
 *
 * To distinguish language variants for countries, regions, or writing systems (scripts), IETF language
 * tags combine subtags from other standards such as ISO 639, ISO 15924, ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49.
 *
 * For example, the tag en stands for English; es-419 for Latin American Spanish; rm-sursilv for Romansh
 * Sursilvan; sr-Cyrl for Serbian written in Cyrillic script; nan-Hant-TW for Min Nan Chinese using
 * traditional Han characters, as spoken in Taiwan; yue-Hant-HK for Cantonese using traditional Han
 * characters, as spoken in Hong Kong; and gsw-u-sd-chzh for ZÃ¼rich German.
 *
 * Each language tag is composed of one or more "subtags" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed
 * of basic Latin letters or digits only.
 *
 * With the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an x- prefix and grandfathered language
 * tags (including those starting with an i- prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag
 * Registry), subtags occur in the following order:
 *
 * - A single primary language subtag based on a two-letter language code from ISO 639-1 (2002) or a
 * three-letter code from ISO 639-2 (1998), ISO 639-3 (2007) or ISO 639-5 (2008), or registered through
 * the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters;

 * - (Not implemented) Up to three optional extended language subtags composed of three letters each,
 * separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language
 * Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of
 * language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.)
 *
 * - An optional script subtag, based on a four-letter script code from ISO 15924 (usually written in Title Case);
 *
 * - An optional region subtag based on a two-letter country code from ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (usually
 * written in upper case), or a three-digit code from UN M.49 for geographical regions;
 *
 * - Optional variant subtags, separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of
 * four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not
 * associated with any external standard.)
 *
 * - (Not implemented) Optional extension subtags, separated by hyphens, each composed of a single
 * character, with the exception of the letter x, and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of
 * two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens;
 *
 * - (Not implemented) An optional private-use subtag, composed of the letter x and a hyphen followed
 * by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens.
 *
 * Subtags are not case-sensitive, but the specification recommends using the same case as in the
 * Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are UPPERCASE, script subtags are Title Case, and
 * all other subtags are lowercase. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the
 * underlying ISO standards.
 *
 * Optional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing
 * information to a language tag. For example, es is preferred over es-Latn, as Spanish is fully
 * expected to be written in the Latin script; ja is preferred over ja-JP, as Japanese as used in Japan
 * does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.
 *
 * Not all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional
 * dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags. For example, the valencia variant
 * subtag for the Valencian variant of the Catalan is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the
 * prefix ca. As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ES can normally be
 * omitted.
 *
 * Furthermore, there are script tags that do not refer to traditional scripts such as Latin, or even
 * scripts at all, and these usually begin with a Z. For example, Zsye refers to emojis, Zmth to mathematical
 * notation, Zxxx to unwritten documents and Zyyy to undetermined scripts.
